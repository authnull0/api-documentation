# Priviliged Access Management(PAM)

-

Privileged access management (PAM) is the combination of tools and technology used to secure, control and monitor access to an organizationâ€™s critical information and resources. Subcategories of PAM include shared access password management, privileged session management and application access management.

Privileged access management (PAM), a subdivision of Identity and Access Management (IAM), is a solution that provides organizations with better control and monitoring capabilities that decide who can have privileged access to critical assets, say, a computer or information system.

The solution should include the following functionalities:

Defining user roles Granting required privileges or access rights for the roles defined Distributing user information and access grants to all devices and systems that enforce access rights in organizations Monitoring privileged user activities and analyzing the same to detect anomalies

# Installation Of Authnull Microservices

To install Authnull Microservices repository in your system, you can follow these general steps:

1.Install the framework: You can install the framework by following the instructions provided in their respective documentation.
Link for the same : `https://goa.design/implement/implementing/`

2.Create a project: Once the framework is installed, create a new project using the command-line interface (CLI) or integrated development environment (IDE) provided by the framework. You can also use any existing project as a starting point.

3.Define the microservices: Identify the different components of your application that can be broken down into smaller, more manageable microservices. Define the interface for each microservice.

4.Implement the microservices: Write the code for each microservice, including the APIs for communication between the different microservices.

5.Test the microservices: To facilitate testing of each microservice,there are a unit tests for each component of the microservice. These unit tests can be automatically triggered and executed during the continuous integration (CI) process, helping to ensure that each microservice is functioning as expected. The unit tests can be stored in a dedicated folder such as /test within the Git repository.

6.Deploy the microservices: Deploy each microservice to a separate container or virtual machine.

7.Monitor the microservices: Monitor the performance of each microservice and the overall system. Use metrics and logs to identify issues and improve the system.

These are the general steps to install a microservices repository for backend APIs.
